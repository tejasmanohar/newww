Hit me up about whatever! I'm usually nice and certainly don't bite.

If you require a response, please contact me via email at _'me' [at] this domain_.
If you'd like to send me an encrypted message (for whatever reason), see my [Keybase profile](https://keybase.io/tejasmanohar).

If you're in the Bay Area and like my work, let's meet up!

## Warning

Due to time constraints, I sometimes ignore certain emails.
Don't take it personally.
- **Open source.** You're more likely to get help (maybe even from me!)
via GitHub, StackOverflow, IRC, etc.
- **Typical gigs.** I'm not interested in joining just another company as
just another developer. I'd need to find a new _class_ of opportunity to consider
a move at this time (e.g. academia, entrepreneurship, leadership, something _new_).
