# README

The code that powers my little corner of the internet. Nothing much to see here.
It's only a public repo so I can use GitHub pages.

## Credits

- I copied the overall look from [crisp](https://github.com/kathyqian/crisp),
an open-source Ghost theme that I (manually) ported to Jekyll. I made various
nitpick changes to the footer, navigation, social buttons, code highlighting, etc.,
but props to [Kathy Qian](https://github.com/kathyqian) for the design.
